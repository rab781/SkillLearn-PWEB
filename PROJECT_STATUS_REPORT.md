// Fallback Web Routes
Route::prefix('web')->middleware('auth:web')->group(function () {
    // Web-based fallback routes for core functionality
});
```

### Frontend (Blade + JavaScript)
```javascript
// Dual Endpoint Strategy
async function submitData(endpoint, data) {
    let response = await fetch(`/api/${endpoint}`, options);
    if (!response.ok && response.status === 401) {
        response = await fetch(`/web/${endpoint}`, webOptions);
    }
    return response;
}
```
