## 🔧 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### 💻 Development Security

```php
// ✅ Good: Using parameterized queries
$users = DB::table('users')->where('email', $email)->get();

// ❌ Bad: Direct string concatenation
$users = DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'");

// ✅ Good: Input validation
$request->validate([
    'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|min:8|max:255'
]);

// ✅ Good: Authorization checks
$this->authorize('update', $course);

// ✅ Good: CSRF protection
@csrf
<form method="POST" action="/submit">

// ✅ Good: Output encoding
{{ $user->name }}

// ❌ Bad: Raw output
{!! $user->name !!}
```

### 🗄️ Database Security

```php
// ✅ Good: Using Eloquent relationships
$user->courses()->attach($courseId);

// ✅ Good: Mass assignment protection
protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
protected $guarded = ['id', 'is_admin'];

// ✅ Good: Password hashing
$user->password = Hash::make($password);
```

### 📁 File Security

```php
// ✅ Good: File validation
$request->validate([
    'image' => 'required|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg|max:2048'
]);

// ✅ Good: Secure file storage
$path = $request->file('image')->store('images', 'public');

// ✅ Good: File type checking
$mimeType = $file->getMimeType();
if (!in_array($mimeType, ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'])) {
    throw new ValidationException('Invalid file type');
}
```
